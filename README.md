# Film Hunter

Tell me the truth, every time you go looking for something new to watch on Netflix it's a struggle to find it, isn't it? For me too...
After a lot of thinking about a solution to this problem, I decided to create a movie search engine based on a genetic algorithm, basically you select 3 movies from a list of 300 and the system crosses the films, generating a gigantic list of crossings and separates the 3 best ones for present as suggestions.

To develop this system I used a database of 6000 international movies from Imdb, Python and Pandas for adjusting, cleaning and normalizing the data and Angular for the Single Page Application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
